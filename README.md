#### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.js®` and an `npm` package manager.

###### Node.js
Angular 11 requires `Node.js` version 10.13 or later.

- To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

###### Angular CLI
Install the Angular CLI globally using a terminal/console window.
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Installation

Step 1: Clone the repository in local machine.
Step 2: Run: npm install (It will load the NgModule, if any error comes then try removing the NgModule folder and run the command again)
Step 3: Run npm start and open http://localhost:4200/. Website will get opened

Unit Testing
To check unit testing run npm test
